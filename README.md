# Programming-Portfolio
By: Ailish Stein

This programming portfolio is intended to display a sampling of my undergraduate programming experience. 

Each programming language is separated into its own branch, pulling off of the main.

If you have never used GitHub, please read the directions below on how to navigate my code repository.
1. Begin by clicking on the drop down menu that reads "main" at the top left corner of the code section of the "Programming-Portfolio" repository.
2. Next, select which branch you would like to explore.
3. Click on any file to read the contents.
4. To navigate back to the branch to view more files, click on the hyperlink "Programming-Portfolio" which is located next to the title of the branch you selected. This will bring you back to the selection of files in the branch you selected in Step 2.
5. To select a different branch, click the drop-down menu described in Step 1 and select a different branch.

I want to thank you for taking the time to check out my code!
